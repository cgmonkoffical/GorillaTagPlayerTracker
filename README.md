# Setup (CREDIT TO LARSON)


**Step one**

Create a discord server with two channels in it, one named logs and one names tracker.
 
**Step two**

Create a webhook for both of these channels, then put the webhook for the *tracker* discord channel into **Snippet_main** (line 5) and put the webhook for the logs discord 
channel into the **Snippet_logs** and **Session_ticket**.

**Step three**

On lines 258 and 345 paste in the buyers role id where it says **BUYER_ROLE_ID**
 
**Step four**

Import the **Main.py** file into replit (or any other code executor) and press the green run button.
 
**Step five**

The console will then prompt you to input a username, wich can be anything you want.
 
**Step six**

The console will then prompt you to input your ticket (steam auth ticket)
 
**Step seven** 

Leave gorilla tag and the replit page up and you will be lucky enough to track someone!!!
